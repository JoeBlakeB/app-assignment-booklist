## Usage

To start the server run:

`./server.py`

The default host is `0.0.0.0` and port is `80` and you can change it with the `--host` and `--port`:

`./server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080`

Data is stored in `./data` and this can be changed with `--data-dir`:

`./server.py --data-dir /path/to/data/directory/`

By default waitress will be used as the WSGI if it is installed and will use werkzeug (the built-in WSGI) if it isn't. To force the server to only use werkzeug add the `--werkzeug` argument:

`./server.py --werkzeug`

To stop the server send a KeyboardInterrupt (ctrl + C).
